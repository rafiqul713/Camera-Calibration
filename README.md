#Camera Calibration#
Camera calibration is the procedure of estimating camera parameters. The camera parameters are divided into two catagories: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic parameters are focal length, distortion. The extrinsic parameters are camera position. 
Camera calibration is used to measure the size of an object in the real world, correct lens distortion, determine the location of the camera in the image. 

## Motivation ##
The goal of the camera calibration is to achieve the accurate representation of the real world image as well as minimize the distortion in  the image.


## Application ##
* Machine Vision
* Robotics (Navigation System) 
* Autonomous Car
